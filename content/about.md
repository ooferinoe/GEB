## The Fall of Humanity

It began with the Oracle Cells—tiny, self-replicating organisms that defied all
understanding. They consumed everything in their path and transformed into monstrous
entities known as Aragami. Immune to conventional weapons, these creatures swiftly rose
to dominate the planet, driving humanity to the brink of extinction.

## The Birth of God Eaters

In humanity’s darkest hour, a glimmer of hope emerged. Scientists discovered a way to
weaponize Oracle Cells, creating the God Arcs—living weapons capable of matching the
Aragami. Those chosen to wield these weapons became known as God Eaters, humanity’s
last line of defense.

## A Fractured World

The Aragami have reshaped the world into a hostile wasteland. Most of humanity now
lives in fortified settlements under the protection of Fenrir, a global organization dedicated
to eradicating the Aragami. Fenrir is also responsible for managing the God Eaters and
developing new technologies to combat the ever-evolving threat.

## The Threat Within

But all is not as it seems. Whispers of corruption within Fenrir and strange mutations
among the Aragami hint at deeper, more insidious dangers. As the Aragami grow stronger
and more cunning, the lines between predator and prey blur. Even the God Eaters, once
humanity's greatest hope, begin to question their purpose in this endless cycle of
destruction.

## Then Endless Hunt

In this shattered world, survival is a constant battle. God Eaters fight not only to reclaim
the earth but to uncover the truth about the Aragami, the Oracle Cells, and the shadowy
forces pulling the strings. Each mission is a step closer to salvation—or annihilation.
