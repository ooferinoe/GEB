## City of Mercy

| ![City of Mercy](/Fields/City.jpg) | ![Overlay](/Fields/CityMap.jpg) |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |

Part of a city where many people gathered right after the Aragami appeared. The protective barricade around the
residential area, with a church at its center, still stands. No sign of human life here: only the wreckage of the
buildings remain, like so many gravestones. In a time of no God to turn to, who do the people pray to?

## Wailing Plains

| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |

Giant tornadoes still swirl around these plains. This was once part of a city of high-rises. Perhaps due to 
environmental changes, the skies are always covered by heavy rain clouds, and the ground is covered with moss
and fungi. There is a crater in the center, as if a meteor had fallen there. Giant Aragami have been sighted in
this area. There is no known link between this crater, the tornadoes, and the giant Aragami. Research is needed.

## Sunken Grid

| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

The remains of a power plant that once supplied electricity to neighbouring cities. It looks like a forest, thanks
to changes in the environment that allowed greenery to flourish, and the steel towers dotting the landscape. After
the Aragami devoured the underground facilities, most of the plant sank underwater. There is no more din and
bustle…nothing but the sad sound of water running through the plant.

## Tranquil Temple

| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

A secret village where people of faith reside in peace. The temple, once the center of village life, has been half-destroyed
by Aragami, and the interior is filled with snow. The sound of the freezing wind blowing across the lands might very well
be the tragic cries of those who lost their lives to the Aragami… The dull light of the moon assuages the grief of those
wandering souls.

## Forgoten Carrier

| ![Forgoten Carrier](/Fields/Forgot.jpg) | ![Overlay](/Fields/ForgotMap.jpg) |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

In the past, there was a faction which took advantage of the chaos when the Aragami appeared, plundering from a carrier.
Many battles were fought between the plunderers and those who stood up to them. Suddenly, a massive herd of Aragami appeared
and both camps collapsed, and the war between humans was ended, ironically, by Aragami. The carrier crashed onto the coast
during the battle and the wreckage remains to this day, a testament to humankind’s folly.

## Infernal Subway

| ![Infernal Subway](/Fields/Subway.jpg) | ![Overlay](/Fields/SubwayMap.jpg) |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

Underground city ruins where magma flows. In the past, the subway tracks were used as a refugee intake route leading to the
Den. The keloid-like Aragami wreckage covering the walls is thought to be evidence that giant Aragami once burrowed deep 
underground and tried to devour magma, only to burst when they were unable to withstand such tremendous energy. Details are
unclear. The sight of magma continuing to flow in the pitch-black darkness is like a scene from hell.
