## The Protagonist
| ![Yuu Kannagi](/Characters/Yuu.jpg) | ![Aki Tamashiro](/Characters/Aki.jpg) | ![Protagonists](/Characters/Protagonist.jpg) |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

### Biography

The Protagonist climbs through the ranks from Recruit to Lieutenant and eventually
become Leader of the First Unit. They are regarded as an exemplary leader. The
protagonist also possesses the power of Resonance, the ability to synchronize the
memories and experiences of others, an ability shared by 2nd Generation New-Type God
Eaters. This first happens when they visit [Alisa](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#alisa-ilinichina-amiella) in the Sick Bay, reliving the experience of
Alisa's parents being killed by a [Dyaus Pita](http://localhost:1313/post/aragami/#dyaus-pita). They cannot control this ability willingly,
though it tends to happen with those they have a connection to.

After the fall of Aegis Island and the destruction left behind in the wake of Nova's
departure, their life remains mostly uneventful until the Firelords in a Storm mission, where
they are critically injured and their God Arc damaged after the Hannibal returns to life after
having its core extracted. As they go on to protect Licca from an Aragami attack on the
Den by using [Lindow](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#lindow-amamiya)'s God Arc. While it rejects them, they meet [Ren](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#ren). The two fight
together later on against a black strain of [Hannibal](http://localhost:1313/post/aragami/#hannibal) -- one that they realize, through a
Resonance, is Lindow Amamiya transformed.

The protagonist goes on to use their Resonance power to get into Lindow's mind, fight the
[Corrosive Hannibal](http://localhost:1313/post/aragami/#corrosive-hannibal) trying to take over alongside him, and eventually, kill it with the aid of
Ren -- or rather, Lindow's original God Arc. This brings the former First Unit Leader back to
normal, with a new Aragami arm to show for his transformation.

## Lindow Amamiya

| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |

### Biography

Lindow Amamiya was formerly the head of the legendary First Unit of the Fenrir Far East
Branch. After happening upon critical top-secret info, Lindow was reported MIA (Missing
In Action) during the Moon in the Welkin mission after being attacked by an Aragami.
However, Lindow survived the mission, but a [Dyaus Pita](http://localhost:1313/post/aragami/#dyaus-pita) appeared afterwards and he was
forced to fight it. The Dyaus Pita destroyed and devoured his God Arc's armlet, but [Shio](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#shio)
subsequently appeared and saved him.

While missing, his Aragami cells began to take over his body as his armlet was no longer
there to control them with Bias Factor injections, resulting in his God Arc's now
uncontained Oracle Cells completely subsuming his right arm and causing immense pain
as well as affecting his behavior. While in this state, Shio helped him control the pain and
slow down the transformation. Eventually, he mutated into a [Corrosive Hannibal](http://localhost:1313/post/aragami/#corrosive-hannibal) once the
Aragami infection took over his entire body.

Notably, his previous personality was somewhat intact post-transformation, saving Tatsumi
O'Mori's group before his Aragami half took over and turned on them. However, arriving
on the scene, the [Protagonist](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#the-protagonist) saves them and experiences a resonance as he and Lindow
clash before the Aragami departs. Officially resuming the search for Lindow that had since
been called off, the Protagonist and [Ren](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#ren) find him in this state, on Aegis Island, and engage
him in combat, after which the Protagonist is sent directly into Lindow's subconscious via a
second resonance. After a trip through Lindow's mind, the two eventually reach Lindow's
true self, and Lindow, alongside the Protagonist, fights a manifestation of the Corrosive
Hannibal to free himself from the mutation.

Presently, he is still a part of the Fenrir Far East Branch. Thanks to the sacrifice of Ren, who
was in fact a manifestation of Lindow's own God Arc, the Aragami infection subsided and
has ceased spreading.

### Biography

Sakuya plays the role of support in and out of combat. She is very emotional when it
comes to the subject of [Lindow Amamiya](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#lindow-amamiya); becoming openly distraught when he goes
missing but eventually calms down in order to focus on her duties. When evidence points
to his status as alive, she expresses joy and hope. It can be said she overreacts slightly
when such evidence is presented.

## Soma Schicksal
 
| ![Soma Schicksal](/Characters/Soma1.jpg) | ![Soma Schicksal](/Characters/Soma2.jpg) |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

### Biography

Soma is introduced during an early mission. He is aloof and lonely, and many God Eaters
try to avoid him due to the high number of casualties that seem to take place near him.
True to the rumors, during the [Protagonist](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#the-protagonist)'s first mission with him, Eric der Vogelweid is
brutally killed by an [Ogretail](http://localhost:1313/post/aragami/#ogretail).

Soma's already a veteran God Eater and is the basis for all God Eaters, since he was the
first human to be injected with Bias Factor. The test proved to be both a success and a
failure, for even though Soma possessed superhuman abilities even at an early age, his
birth caused the death of his mother, something that made him blame himself for her
death.

When the 1st Unit captures [Shio](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#shio), Soma is at first distrustful and wary of her, calling her a
monster and avoiding any interaction with her. However, as time goes on, they develop a
strong friendship. Eventually, Johannes (Soma's father) captures Shio as part of his plan to
unleash a Devouring Apocalypse, Soma and the rest of the 1st Unit converge on Aegis
Island and fight him as he explains how his plan has come to fruition. However, against all
odds, Shio takes Nova away to the moon, saving the world.

Soma is then designed by newly-appointed Director Paylor Sakaki as the man in charge of
searching and collecting leftover Nova fragments, so as to avoid any incidents. However,
an Aragami forms from those remnants: Arius Nova. Soma is quick to blame himself for
the Aragami's outbreak, and rushes to fight it during the 1st Unit's first encounter with it.
He is easily defeated by the mighty Aragami, and he spends some time in the Den's
Healing Bay. Unknown to him at the moment, however, a girl similar to Shio appears and
saves the entire 1st Unit, driving away the Aragami. It is later theorized that the girl isn't
Shio, but actually just a remnant of Nova who took on her form.

Eventually, after acquiring several rare Bias factors, the 1st Unit finally manages to defeat
the Arius Nova. From the dead Aragami's Oracle Cells, another "shadow" of Shio appears,
and the entire 1st Unit says goodbye to her as the Oracle Cells vanish and go to the moon,
where the real Shio was.

### Biography

Kota was invited to the Far East Branch, Anagura, the same day as the [Protagonist](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#the-protagonist). He
often returns to the residential area to present gifts to his mother and sister Nozomi, who
live nearby in the Outer Ghetto. When Director Schicksal goes public with his plan to reset
the world, Kota initially didn't fight the decision, in order to give his family a chance to be
safely away from the Aragami. However, after careful contemplation, and realizing what
consequences would unfold, he joined the rest of the God Eaters in opposing von
Schicksal's plan.

| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

### Biography

Alisa, one of the New-Type God Eaters, was transferred from the Fenrir Russian branch to
the Far East Branch. Her parents were killed by an Aragami, so she has prejudices towards
these beings until she meets [Shio](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#shio). She plays a key part in [Lindow](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#lindow-amamiya)'s disappearance. During
the Moon in the Welkin mission, her fear of the Aragami that killed her family triggers a
nervous breakdown, which also activates a subconscious command implanted by the
Director in part of his plot to counter Lindow's spy mission on the Ark Project. While she
was supposed to shoot Lindow directly, her shot instead traps him. This murderous
command is again used when [Sakuya](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#sakuya-tachibana) and Alisa confront Schicksal in Aegis, causing her to
momentarily turn on Sakuya. However, Sakuya knocks her out with a recovery bullet and
escapes with her. No further signs of this subconscious control are shown.

## Shio

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |

### Biography

She is a mysterious pale girl who appeared before the God Eaters. The weapon she uses
manifests from her hands.

Shio evidently has a lot of curiosity, whether born of her innate Aragami hunger or a
quality given by her human traits. She is especially curious of Fenrir's activity, she is first
shown wearing a dress made from a Fenrir flag. Shio shares a unique bond with [Soma Schicksal](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#soma-schicksal).
Soma considers Shio to be the same as him (a human-shaped monster), and
thus is protective and friendly with the Aragami (although he tries his best not to show it).
He is one of the most affected by Shio's departure, and afterwards his God Arc turns white
due to devouring her leftover vessel. At the ending credits, her figure is shown watching
the Earth from the plant-surrounded moon.

### Biography

Ren seems to know a lot about [Lindow](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#lindow-amamiya), and can recount interactions between Lindow and
the [Protagonist](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#the-protagonist) on the field almost as if he was there. He was revealed to be Lindow's God
Arc (personified). This explains such things as why only the Protagonist can see him
(having absorbed the God Arc) and why he knows so much about Lindow. Ren urges the
Protagonist to end Lindow's life; whether it is because he feels pity or because it is in his
nature is unknown. When entering Lindow's mind, he helps the Protagonist to reawaken
Lindow's consciousness, and afterwards retakes his God Arc form to help Lindow fight the
[Corrosive Hannibal](http://localhost:1313/post/aragami/#corrosive-hannibal) he had become. The Protagonist and Lindow manage to defeat the
Corrosive Hannibal, but then the beast reappears in a much larger form and overwhelms
them. Ren reappears and sacrifices himself to protect them, permanently stopping the
Aragami mutation from Lindow's arm to spread through the rest of his body which is he
turned back into his God Arc form.
