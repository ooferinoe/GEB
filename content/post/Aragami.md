## Ogretail

| ![Ogretail](/Aragami/Ogretail.jpg) |
| ---------------------------------- |

A smaller Aragami with a giant tail sporting an ogre-like face. Mainly devours corpses of
other Aragami. Increasing in number in various regions. First appeared on the American
continent, and now boasts the largest population of all Aragami. Not particularly difficult
to take out when attacking from the side. Still, as its tail-spinning attack is powerful, be
wary of it when it braces both legs.

## Zygote

| ![Zygote](/Aragami/Zygote.jpg) |
| ------------------------------ |

A flying Aragami that looks like a woman fused with an egg shell. Highly mobile, it
dispersed worldwide after first appearing on the American continent. Brimming with
poisonous gas harmful to the human body.

Able to move over a wide range, it can also summon other Aragami once it spots a human.
Try to defeat it before it joins forces with other Aragami.

## Cocoon Maiden

| ![Cocoon Maiden](/Aragami/Maiden.jpg) |
| ------------------------------------- |

A unique battery-shaped Aragami which clings immobile to the ground. Though no one
has ever seen it in motion, the fact that it exists worldwide makes it more than likely that it
moves along the ground at night.

Armed with precise, long-range laser and a close-range poisonous needle. The best plan
of attack would be to sweep behind it and land a crushing blow.

## Kongou

| ![Kongou](/Aragami/Kongou.jpg) |
| ------------------------------ |

An Aragami built like a giant ape-man. Characterized by its agility and brutal attacks. It will assemble a herd to launch an
attack. First appeared in the Far East, Eurasian continent.

It'll fire vacuum waves from the pipe-shaped organs on its back. When enraged, it boosts its speed and attack power.
Should several Kongous activate simultaneously, it's best to be cautious.

## Gboro-Gboro

| ![Gboro-Gboro](/Aragami/Gboro.jpg) |
| ------------------------------ |

Amphibian Aragami bearing huge fins and a head. Looks like an alligator. Shoots multiple water spheres from a turret-shaped
protuberance. Despite appearing sluggish, it can move quite fast. First appeared on the southeastern Eurasian continent.

The water spheres shot can cover a wide range, and its biting power is strong. Avoid head-on combat, and stay alert even when
you're behind its back.

## Chi-You

| ![Chi-You](/Aragami/Chi.jpg) |
| ---------------------------- |

A human-form Aragami with rigid wings. Good at melee attacking with its wings, as well as focusing its energy in its fists,
and letting it loose. First appeared in central Eurasia.

It's difficult to run a sword through Chi-You's wings. First destroy its lower body and wings with crush type gunfire before
striking with the sword. When enraged, it'll glide even faster.

## Vajra

| ![Vajra](/Aragami/Vajra.jpg) |
| ---------------------------- |

A giant Aragami resembling a tiger. Moves so fast and can easily outmaneuver the enemy. Unleashes electric shocks from
the cape-like organ on its back. First appeared in southwestern Eurasia, but can now be found throughout the continent.

Vulnerable in the front legs, abdomen and tail. When it's activated by rage, stun grenades can immobilize it for a longer
time, so use them aggressively.

## Borg Camlann

| ![Borg Camlann](/Aragami/Borg.jpg) |
| ---------------------------------- |

A scorpion-like Aragami with a stinger and shield. Resembles a knight, with a metallic outer skin. Attacks after causing its
enemy to lose balance. First appeared in the south of Great Britain.

Displays remarkable power and range when attacking with its tail. Hard to destroy its shell by sword, so knock it off balance
by slashing its legs, then shooting at its weak point - the mouth.

## Sariel

| ![Sariel](/Aragami/Sariel.jpg) |
| ------------------------------ |

An Aragami resembling a human fused with a butterfly. Emits rays of light from its forehead: baffles God Eaters as it floats
seductively through the sky. Thought to have first appeared along the Mediterranean coast. Hard to inflict serious damage while
in mid-air, so shoot it down, then attack it with one's sword. Launches long-distance homing attacks as well as debuff attacks,
so take advantage of the terrain and stay mobile.

## Quadriga

| ![Quadriga](/Aragami/Quad.jpg) |
| ------------------------------ |

A huge Aragami with a tank-like armor. Capable of intense shelling, emulating a man-made weapon; also displays surprising
mobility for its colossal size. Thought to have first appeared on the Mediterranean coast.

Hard to run one's sword through its armor. Blast its missile pods with gunfire, or bring it down by shooting at its legs.
When activated by rage, its anti-physical elements become more effective.

## Ouroboros

| ![Ouroboros](/Aragami/Ouro.jpg) |
| ------------------------------- |

A uniquely-shaped huge Aragami with innumerable tentacles and eyes. Also known as the Conqueror of the Plains, its body is
the size of a mountain. As well as its tentacle attacks, it emits a large-caliber beam. Origins unknown.

Avoid medium-to-long range combat. Stay out of its reach and repulse it with gunfire, then strike with one's sword to be
safe. When activated by rage, its legs become vulnerable.

## Prithvi Mata

| ![Prithvi Mata](/Aragami/Mata.jpg) |
| ---------------------------------- |

A giant Aragami with the face of a cruel goddess. Defends itself while attacking the enemy
by causing blocks of ice to rise. Said to have first appeared in northeastern Eurasia. It has
been seen a lot since the "Moon in the Welkin" mission.

Disperses cold air. When enraged, its body goes rigid, so destroy its shoulders and other
body parts to make it easy to run one's sword through.

## Dyaus Pita

| ![Dyaus Pita](/Aragami/Pita.jpg) |
| -------------------------------- |

First spotted during Moon in the Welkin mission. A new type of Aragami, with a jet black
body and evil-lookin face. Possesses both a powerful electric shock attack and an iron-
tight defense mechanism. Worthy of being known as the emperor of Aragami. Origins
unknown. When enraged, its entire body goes rigid: but if its cape-like organ is destroyed,
that part gets soft, and defenses go down. Try to take it out with a crush type gun.

## Arda Nova

| ![Arda Nova](/Aragami/Arda.jpg) |
| ------------------------------- |

A gigantic human-form Aragami built by Director Schicksal under utmost secrecy. The technology for controlling
the bias factor was adapted from God Arcs, and so it's a kind of human-form God Arc.

The Arda Nova can only suffer damage when it is actively attacking, and it is comprised of two bodies, one a
goddess, the other a god. Should you defeat the god first, your close-range attacks on the goddess will be more
effective as the god isn't in the way.

## Hannibal

| ![Hannibal](/Aragami/Hannibal2.jpg) |
| ---------------------------------- |

A new species of Aragami first discovered at the Far East Branch. It looks like a dragon and
can regenerate without a core. The martial moves and ability to form weapons with fire is
strangely similar to human behavior. The dorsal hump contains large amount of heat energy
that will emit great amounts of fire attacks when damaged. Destroy the head or
bracer on the left arm to lower its defense for a sure win.

## Corrosive Hannibal

| ![Corrosive Hannibal](/Aragami/Corrosive.jpg) |
| --------------------------------------------- |

A dark Hannibal, which appeared as a post manifestation of the Oracle cell invasion of
Corporal [Amamiya](http://localhost:1313/post/characters/#lindow-amamiya). Several of the same species have been sighted near the Far East
Branch; however, the relationship with the individual mentioned is still under investigation.

This info is restricted to the Far East Branch.
